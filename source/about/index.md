I am a first year physics student at Uppsala university. For me I always have an big ambition in theoretical physics. Especially M - theory and partical physics. Furthermore I also like to play violin, computer sciencs and maybe maybe.. life sciencs.

The main resoneson that I start my own blog/web is through this site I just want to know my-self better. Sometime I dont know who I am, where I came from and where I want actully go. Hence I hope through this blog I can have a chat with the deep inside me, and also me from the future and the past.

In this blog I want also share my idea about life, universe, physics and everything I know. Although this is insignificant for the the world but that's who am I.
