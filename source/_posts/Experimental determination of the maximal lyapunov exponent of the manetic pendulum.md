**Abstract:**

The magnetic pendulum has a simple structure but a complex chaotic behaviour. Since a system has a positive maximal lyapunov exponent is strong indicates that system is chaotic. The studies of magnetic pendulum have been mathematically and numerically understood. Unfortunately, it is still lack of experimental examination of the lyapunov exponent of magnetic pendulum due the extreme and sensitive requirement. In this project is studied about the maximal lyapunov of magnetic pendulum experimentally. The study is not extensive and specifics for the chaotic behavior of magnetic pendulum. However, the result are showed the magnetic pendulum has a positive maximal lyapunov exponent about 28 1/s with a given parameter. Which is strong indicates that magnetic pendulum has a chaotic behaviour.
